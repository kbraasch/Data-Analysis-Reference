## Population

All subjects of interest have been surveyed and are available for analysis

## Sample

A subset of the population has been surveyed and will provide estimates for the population.

# Descriptive Statistics

Describe, show or summarize data from a sample in a meaningful way.

- Mean
- Distribution
- Standard deviation
- Range
- Variance
- Skew
- Outlier Identification
- Regression
- Contingency table
- Correlation matrix
- Pearson correlation coefficient
- Discriminant analysis
- Factor analysis
- Canonical correlation

# Inferential Statistics (Hypothesis Tests)

Make conclusions from the data sample by using the null and alternative hypotheses that are subjected to random variation.

Parametric: Numerical data that is normally distributed
Non-parametric: Statistics that do not estimate population parameters. Normality assumption are not met.
